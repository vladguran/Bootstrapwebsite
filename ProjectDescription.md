# Project Description: IndustroBots

### - Description and Goals of the Project 
---
The idea of the project is to inform people about industrial roboters and and to introduce the different industrial robots. We want to give an  insight.

### - Static Part
---
The website gives an general overview and then it
describes the different types of industrial roboters. It also shows the programming languages and the structure.
We want to show young, interested people the robots that are working for us.

### - Dynamic Part
---
A possibility for the dynamic part for the website about industrial robots would be to implement an interactive control surface. Using JavaScript we could create a user interface that allows visitors to the website to control various movements and actions of a virtual industrial robot. With the animation, we could use buttons to get the industrial robot to grab and move objects. 

### - Main tasks
---
* Static part (already done)
* We want to add the interactive control surface by May the 25th.
* We want a login by April the 27th.

### - Source Version Control System
---
Every file that we use is on github.
