# Project Description

## Industrial Roboter

### - Description and Goals of the Project 
---
The idea of the project is to inform people about industrial roboters and and to introduce the different industrial robots. We want to give an  insight.

### - Static Part
---
The website gives an general overview and then it
describes the different types of industrial roboters. It also shows the programming languages and the structure.

### - Dynamic Part
---
A possibility for the dynamic part for the website about industrial robots would be to implement an interactive control surface. Using JavaScript we could create a user interface that allows visitors to the website to control various movements and actions of a virtual industrial robot. With the animation, we could use buttons to get the industrial robot to grab and move objects. 

### - Main tasks
---
* Static part (already done)
* We want to add the interactive control surface by May the 25th.
* We want a login by April the 27th.
