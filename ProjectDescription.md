# Project Description: IndustroBots

### - Description and Goals of the Project 
---
The idea of the project is to inform people about industrial roboters and and to introduce the different industrial robots. We want to give an  insight. An industrial robot website is a website that provides information about industrial robots. Industrial robots are computer-controlled machines used in industrial manufacturing to perform repetitive, dangerous, or complex tasks. This website would provide specific information about industrial robots, such as:

Functioning: The website would explain how industrial robots are programmed and controlled and how they can perceive their environment using sensors and cameras.

Overall, an industrial robot website would help users better understand the potential of industrial robots in their production environment and make the best decisions to optimize their processes.

### - Static Part
---
The website gives an general overview and then it
describes the different types of industrial roboters. It also shows the programming languages and the structure.
We want to show young, interested people the robots that are working for us.

### - Dynamic Part
---
A possibility for the dynamic part for the website about industrial robots would be to implement an interactive control surface. Using JavaScript we could create a user interface that allows visitors to the website to control various movements and actions of a virtual industrial robot. With the animation, we could use buttons to get the industrial robot to grab and move objects. 
We also want to include a login. This would allow us, for example, to create a community only for users who have registered. We may also restrict access to certain site features.

### - Main tasks
---
* Static part (already done)
* We want to add the interactive control surface by May the 25th.
* We want a login by April the 27th.

### - Source Version Control System
---
Every file that we use is on github.
